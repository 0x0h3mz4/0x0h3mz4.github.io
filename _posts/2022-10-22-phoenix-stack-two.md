# Phoenix stack 2

```c
/*
 * phoenix/stack-two, by https://exploit.education
 *
 * The aim is to change the contents of the changeme variable to 0x0d0a090a
 *
 * If you're Russian to get to the bath room, and you are Finnish when you get
 * out, what are you when you are in the bath room?
 *
 * European!

Equally to [stack1](https://0x0h3mz4.github.io/2022/10/22/phoenix-stack-one.html) except that an environment variable must be set.

Initially, letâ€™s run the program without setting the environment variable:

Then Letâ€™s set that sucker with some python scripting!

Letâ€™s print that sucker

Tbh I donâ€™t know if `0x0d0a090a` has been added at the end of those As, since I donâ€™t want to convert `0x0d0a090a` to a string to make sure.

Letâ€™s test that anyways ðŸ˜…

Congrats, it has been set!!!
