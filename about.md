Hi there!

As a software engineer, I view code like an artist views their paint palette - a tool for creating and bringing new ideas to life. However, I also understand that with great power comes great responsibility - that's why I prioritize the security aspect, to protect users from potential adversaries.

I used to participate in bug bounty programs mostly on HackerOne but I soon realized that the effort required often outweighed the potential rewards.

In fact, to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques in cybersecurity, I enjoy playing capture the flag (CTF) competitions and other challenges.

Through my blog, I am journaling my journey as a software engineer and cybersecurity enthusiast. By sharing my experiences and insights with the world, I hope to inspire others to explore this exciting and rapidly-evolving field, while also raising awareness about the importance of digital security and ethical technology use.
