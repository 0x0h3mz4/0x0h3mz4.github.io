Hi there!

When I was a child, I enjoyed doing pranks to my friends and family, like spying on the camera, spying on the wire, make them click links to take them to funny websites... I've never been aware of how those tools work, I was just using them for fun.
In fact, I was a script kiddie!

I am now a software engineering student.
I love doing ctfs and cybersec related challenges.

I'm journaling my journey of going beyond being a script kiddie and sharing it with the world.
