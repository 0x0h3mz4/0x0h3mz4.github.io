I"ù<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>When I was a child, I enjoyed doing pranks to my friends and family, like spying on the camera, spying on the wire, make them click links to take them to funny websitesâ€¦ Iâ€™ve never been aware of how those tools work, I was just using them for fun.
In fact, I was a script kiddie!</p>

<p>I am now a software engineering student.
I love doing ctfs and cybersec related challenges.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m journaling my journey of going beyond being a script kiddie and Iâ€™m sharing it.</p>
